# Imrans-Social-Network-API

## Description

The Social Network API is a project where I built the APIs on the backend for a social network web application. It allows users to share their thoughts, are able to react to friend's thoughts, and create a friends list. This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.
